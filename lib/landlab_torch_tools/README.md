# landlab_torch_tools
A PyTorch Dataset for Landlab Model Runs

This is PyTorch dataset for Landlab data created with the [landlab_batcher](https://github.com/jrymart/landlab_batcher) utility.  The labels are in the database keeping track of the model runs, and the output runs are in .npy files stored in a directory.
